**Innate Ability**: If you start your in [<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/all/battle-forms/magic), gain 1 [tenacity](/docs/all/other/tenacity).

| Tenacity Cost | Name | Ability |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Power Surge | Spend any amount of additional [tenacity](/docs/all/other/tenacity). Choose an adventurer to recover the leftmost number of dice from their cooldown track equal to the additional amount spent. |
| 2 | Lightning Splash | **[Interrupt](/docs/all/other/interrupt):** After you defeat an enemy, deal 2 damage to every [unit](/docs/all/other/unit) that was in that enemy's [range](/docs/all/other/range).  |
| 2 | Unholy Knowledge | [<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/all/battle-forms/magic): Roll any status die in any adventurer's cooldown track and place it back in the same position with the new result. |
| 3 | Dark Exchange | [<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/all/battle-forms/magic): Remove 1 HP from yourself and from any [unit](/docs/all/other/unit) in [range](/docs/all/other/range). Add both chips to any other unit in range (may exceed [Health](/docs/all/stats/health) stat). |
| 4 | Blood Magic | [<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/all/battle-forms/magic): Each adventurer in play heals to full HP, then gains light [fatigue](/docs/all/other/fatigue) equal to the amount of HP healed. Light fatigue that cannot be placed does not generate overfatigue. |
