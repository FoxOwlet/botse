hoverText: "Dice are placed here as the adventurer exhausts their skill dice or gains fatigue and status effect dice."

Dice are placed here as the [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) exhausts their skill dice or gains [fatigue](/docs/all/glossary/fatigue) and [status effect](/docs/all/status-effects/) dice. The [Cooldown](/docs/all/stats/cooldown) determines the number of dice that are removed from the track each [turn](/docs/all/glossary/turn).

Dice still in an [adventurer's](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) cooldown track at the end of a battle remain there until the next battle or until they are removed by other means, such as during the [End of Day Phase](/docs/all/day/end-of-day-phase) or visiting a town's inn.

### Cooldown Track on Skill Abilities
<img src="/icons/cooldown-track.svg" alt="Cooldown Track Icon" />

This skill die is exhausted. The die's ability is resolved as described in its entry and is typically ongoing until it is removed from the cooldown track. If for any reason you decide not to resolve a <img src="/icons/cooldown-track.svg" alt="Cooldown Track Icon" class="icon-svg" /> result, place it in your cooldown track with the [<img src="/icons/tenacity.svg" alt="Tenacity Icon" class="icon-svg"/>](/docs/all/glossary/tenacity) result face up (without gaining [tenacity](/docs/all/glossary/tenacity)).
