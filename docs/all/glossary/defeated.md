### Defeating Units
Some abilities refer to units defeating other units, either as part of an effect or for triggering another effect.

These abilities follow the definitions below:

-   An [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) (or [companion](/docs/all/glossary/companion)) defeats an [enemy](/docs/all/glossary/enemy) when either of the following occurs:
    -   That enemy loses its last HP chip because of an engage or ability resolved by the adventurer.
    -   The adventurer resolves an ability that indicates that enemy is defeated.
-   An [enemy](/docs/all/glossary/enemy) defeats a [unit](/docs/all/glossary/unit) when that unit loses its last HP chip, either because of an engage or ability resolved by that enemy.
-   If a [unit](/docs/all/glossary/unit) is defeated by a [status effect](/docs/all/status-effects/) die, such as [Bane (<img src="/icons/bane.svg" alt="Bane Icon" class="icon-svg" />)](/docs/all/status-effects/bane), it is considered defeated but does not trigger any effect that requires the unit to have been defeated by a specific other unit.

### Defeated Units on Tiles
Some encounter rules or other abilities refer to defeated [units](/docs/all/glossary/unit) remaining on the tiles in battle.

These units follow the rules below:

-   The unit's chip remains in its hex until it is removed as described by the effect. Until the chip is removed, its hex is considered [occupied](/docs/all/glossary/occupied).
-   While it is on the battle map, that defeated [unit](/docs/all/glossary/unit) cannot take turns and its chip is not a [targetable](/docs/all/glossary/targetable) unit for engage actions or other abilities (unless specifically instructed). The unit's chip is treated as a defeated unit of its type for resolving abilities.
