When an [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) performs this action, they spend the required amount of [tenacity](/docs/all/glossary/tenacity) to trigger a class ability. You may gain 1 light [fatigue](/docs/all/glossary/fatigue) to change [battle form](/docs/category/battle-forms/) before resolving the ability. You can only trigger each non-[enduring](/docs/all/glossary/enduring) class ability once during each turn at its correct timing specified in its ability text.

Note that some class abilities are not actions. These class abilities have either the [enduring](/docs/all/glossary/enduring) keyword and are ongoing or have the [interrupt](/docs/all/glossary/interrupt) keyword and must be triggered at the time specified in the ability.s text.
