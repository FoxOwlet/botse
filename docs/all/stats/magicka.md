This stat is tracked by blue square tokens and represents the adventurer's capacity to roll dice for spellcasting skills, as well as those skills' range. Not all adventurers require Magicka, so unlike the other stats, it may be untrained. 

Magicka limits an adventurer's engage action [range](/docs/all/other/range) and number of dice they can roll while in magic battle form [(<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" class="icon-svg" />)](/docs/all/battle-forms/magic).
