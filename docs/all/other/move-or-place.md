Some abilities grant additional movement, which may occur outside of a typical move action. There are also abilities that place a unit, which is different than moving it. Placing a unit is resolved by removing that unit from the map (or from outside the map) and placing it in a hex as described.

A unit that is placed in a hex as part of an ability is **not** treated as if it moved into that hex for triggering effects.
