Range (or distance) from one hex to another is measured by counting the number of hexes between those hexes, including the destination hex, regardless of whether those hexes are [occupied](/docs/all/other/occupied). 

Range or distance is measured when determining how far a unit (or
overland token) can move, whether an enemy is in range to engage adventurers, or whether an adventurer can affect another unit
with a rolled skill die.

A unit is always within range of itself.

### Adventurer's Range
Defined by their current battle form. Some battle forms (such as SYMBOL or SYMBOL) have a range equal to an adventurerâ€™s Stamina or Magicka stat, while others allow only adjacent units to be within range. 

### Enemy's Range
Equal to its range stat.
