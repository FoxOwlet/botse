Range (or distance) from one hex to another is measured by counting the number of hexes between those hexes, including the destination hex, regardless of whether those hexes are [occupied](/docs/all/other/occupied). 

Range or distance is measured when determining how far a unit (or overland token) can move, whether an enemy is in range to engage adventurers, or whether an adventurer can affect another unit with a rolled skill die.

A unit is always within range of itself.

### Adventurer's Range
Defined by their current battle form. Some battle forms (such as [<img src="/icons/ranged-weapon.svg" alt="Ranged Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/all/battle-forms/ranged-weapon) or [<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/all/battle-forms/magic)) have a range equal to an adventurer's [Stamina](/docs/all/stats/stamina) or [Magicka](/docs/all/stats/magicka) stat, while others allow only [adjacent](/docs/all/other/adjacent) units to be within range. 

### Enemy's Range
Equal to its range stat.
