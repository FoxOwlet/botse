When you gain tenacity (<img src="/icons/tenacity.svg" class="icon-svg"/>), you track it using the peg slots at the bottom right side of your adventurer mat. Accumulated tenacity remains until it is spent to trigger a class ability or reduced by another effect. If you increase your tenacity to its maximum value, you cannot increase it again until you spend (or lose) some tenacity. 

Tenacity is typically gained by resolving dice results with the <img src="/icons/tenacity.svg" class="icon-svg"/> icon but can also be gained from other specied dice abilities or effects.
