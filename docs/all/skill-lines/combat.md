This special skill line represents an [adventurer's](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) innate fighting ability. Combat is different from the other skill lines in that it has only 1 type of skill die. Combat dice are flexible enough to be rolled with any battle form except magic ([<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/all/battle-forms/magic)) and can be rolled in defensive battle form ([<img src="/icons/defensive.svg" alt="Defensive Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/all/battle-forms/defensive)) to prevent damage. 

Combat cannot be untrained.

If an ability adds [free](/docs/all/glossary/free) Combat dice, enemy Combat dice are used instead of Combat skill dice. These dice do not count against your [Stamina](/docs/all/stats/stamina) or [Magicka](/docs/all/stats/magicka) stat but are treated as Combat dice for other effectsâ€”such as <img src="/icons/weapon.svg" alt="Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" /> items.

:::info
Although Combat is shown among a [race's](/docs/all/races/) starting attributes, it is a [skill line](/docs/all/skill-lines/) and not a [stat](/docs/category/stats).
